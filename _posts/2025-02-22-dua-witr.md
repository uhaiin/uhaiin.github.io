## Explanation and Interpretation

- **Supplication for Divine Aid and Forgiveness:**  
  The opening phrases, "O Allah, indeed we seek Your help" and "we ask Your forgiveness," express a deep reliance on Allah for support and mercy. The supplicant acknowledges personal limitations and the constant need for divine assistance.

- **Affirmation of Faith and Reliance:**  
  By stating "we believe in You" and "we rely upon You," the dua reaffirms the core Islamic tenets of faith and tawakkul (trust in Allah). This establishes the spiritual foundation upon which the subsequent requests are built.

- **Praise, Gratitude, and Rejection of Ingratitude:**  
  The phrases "we extol Your goodness" and "we thank You" are acts of worship in themselves, reflecting gratitude for Allah's countless blessings. The declaration "we do not disbelieve You" underscores the rejection of ingratitude and hypocrisy.

- **Renunciation of Opposition:**  
  "We renounce and abandon those who act defiantly against You" is a clear stand against any behavior or influence that opposes the divine order, reinforcing the commitment to remain steadfast in faith.

- **Declaration of Exclusive Worship and Devotion:**  
  The latter part of the dua emphasizes exclusive devotion: "it is only You that we worship, and for You we pray and prostrate." This comprehensive declaration covers various forms of worship—prayer, prostration, and hasty response (signifying eagerness in serving Allah).

- **Hope for Mercy and Fear of Punishment:**  
  Concluding with "we hope for Your mercy and fear Your punishment" reminds the believer of Allah's compassion and justice. The final statement reinforces that His punishment is certain for those who disbelieve, urging the worshipper to remain sincere and vigilant.

## Historical and Liturgical Context

- **Usage in the Witr Prayer:**  
  Within the Hanafi school, Dua Qunoot is a well-established part of the Witr prayer, often considered a sunnah mu’akkadah (a strongly recommended practice). This version, in particular, is recited in the final odd-numbered rak’ah of the Isha prayer, marking the concluding supplication of the night.

- **Prophetic Tradition (Sunnah):**  
  Although the exact wording of Qunoot varied in the time of the Prophet Muhammad, the practice of concluding the Witr prayer with a heartfelt supplication is deeply rooted in the Sunnah. This version reflects the comprehensive nature of the Prophet’s own invocations—combining declarations of faith with appeals for mercy, guidance, and protection.

- **Spiritual Emphasis:**  
  The Hanafi version emphasizes both the internal state of submission and the external acts of worship. It serves as a reminder that while believers seek divine help and forgiveness, they must also affirm their exclusive dedication to Allah through worship and righteous actions.

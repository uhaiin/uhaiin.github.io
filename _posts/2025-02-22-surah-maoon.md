### 3. Meaning and Interpretation

- **Denial of the Hereafter:**  
  The surah begins by questioning those who deny the final judgment, linking their disbelief with a failure to uphold essential ethical responsibilities.

- **Neglect of Social Duties:**  
  By highlighting the mistreatment of orphans and the neglect of feeding the poor, the surah criticizes a society where even basic human kindness is overlooked.

- **Critique of Hypocrisy:**  
  The verses warn against performing ritual prayers merely for show. It emphasizes that genuine worship involves mindfulness, sincerity, and a commitment to helping others—especially the vulnerable.

- **Holistic Faith:**  
  The message is clear: mere ritualism without social compassion is hollow. True faith is measured by both one’s spiritual devotion and one’s willingness to engage in “small kindnesses” that uphold justice and care within the community.

### 4. Historical Context and the Situation in the Prophet’s Life

- **Makkan Period:**  
  Surah Al-Maʿūn is generally classified as a Makkan surah, meaning it was revealed in Mecca during the early phase of the Prophet Muhammad’s mission. During this period, the focus of revelation was on establishing a fundamental understanding of monotheism, moral conduct, and social justice.

- **Social Environment:**  
  At that time, Meccan society was deeply divided by tribal loyalties and a strong emphasis on wealth and social status. Many members of the community were indifferent to the plight of the poor, orphans, and other vulnerable groups. The surah directly challenges these societal norms by linking true piety with acts of genuine care and support for those in need.

- **The Prophet’s Mission:**  
  In the early days of his prophethood, Muhammad faced significant resistance and skepticism. His message was not only about spiritual salvation but also about transforming the ethical fabric of society. By revealing Surah Al-Maʿūn, the Prophet emphasized that religious practices should be coupled with tangible acts of kindness and social responsibility—values that were largely absent in the prevailing culture.

- **Response to Superficial Worship:**  
  The surah serves as a corrective measure against those who engaged in outward acts of worship for social status or personal gain while neglecting the moral and communal responsibilities that Islam advocates. It called for introspection and a return to a faith that integrates both inner belief and external actions.

### 5. Conclusion

Surah Al-Maʿūn encapsulates a powerful message that transcends ritualism by insisting that true faith is demonstrated through compassion, social justice, and everyday acts of kindness. Its revelation in the early Meccan period was a direct response to a society where superficial religiosity was prevalent and where the marginalized—such as orphans and the poor—were routinely neglected. This surah remains a timeless reminder that spiritual devotion must go hand in hand with ethical behavior and social responsibility.
